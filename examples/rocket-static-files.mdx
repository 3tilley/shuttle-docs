title: "Static Files"
description: "This article walks you through setting up static files with Rocket, an ergonomic framework for simple web applications."
---

## Description

This example has one route at `/` where the homepage is served and shows you how you can serve HTML or other types of files with Actix Web.

Note that we declare what files we allow our app to serve in the `Shuttle.toml` config file which is should be placed in the project root and only allows files that are within the project folder.

You can clone the example below by running the following (you'll need `cargo-shuttle` installed):
```bash
cargo shuttle init --from shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples \
 --subfolder rocket/static-files
```

## Code
 
<CodeGroup>
```rust src/main.rs

use rocket::fs::{FileServer, relative};

// If we wanted or needed to serve files manually, we'd use `NamedFile`. Always
// prefer to use `FileServer`!
mod manual {
    use std::path::{PathBuf, Path};
    use rocket::fs::NamedFile;

    #[rocket::get("/second/<path..>")]
    pub async fn second(path: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
        let mut path = Path::new(super::relative!("static")).join(path);
        if path.is_dir() {
            path.push("index.html");
        }

        NamedFile::open(path).await.ok()
    }
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build()
        .mount("/", rocket::routes![manual::second])
        .mount("/", FileServer::from(relative!("static")));

	Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

```toml Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "static-files"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.2"
shuttle-rocket = "0.27.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.27.0"
tokio = "1.26.0"
```

```toml Shuttle.toml
assets = ["static/*"]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage

After you clone the example, launch it locally by using `cargo shuttle run` then visit the home route at `http://localhost:8000` - you should see a homepage that shows our included HTML file. 

You can extend this example by adding more routes that serve other files.
